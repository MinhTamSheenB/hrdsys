SELECT CAST(
             CASE 
                  WHEN Obsolete = 'N' or InStock = 'Y' 
                     THEN 1 
                  ELSE 0 
             END AS bit) as Salable, * 
FROM Product

You only need to do the CAST if you want the result as a boolean value, if you are happy with an int, this works:

SELECT CASE 
            WHEN Obsolete = 'N' or InStock = 'Y' 
               THEN 1 
               ELSE 0 
       END as Salable, * 
FROM Product

CASE statements can be embedded in other CASE statements and even included in aggregates.

SQL Server Denali (SQL Server 2012) adds the IIF statement which is also available in access: (pointed out by Martin Smith)

SELECT IIF(Obsolete = 'N' or InStock = 'Y', 1, 0) as Selable, * from Product
